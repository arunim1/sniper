## Technical Highlights

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Carbon Events for Hotkeys**
   - No Accessibility permission needed
   - System-level hotkey registration
   - Better than CGEvent tap

2. **ScreenCaptureKit**
   - Modern API (macOS 13+)
   - Better performance than CGWindowListCreateImage
   - Proper multi-display support

3. **Vision for OCR**
   - Apple's native framework
   - Excellent accuracy
   - Offline processing
   - Multi-language support

4. **SwiftUI for Preferences**
   - Modern, declarative UI
   - Easy data binding
   - Cleaner than AppKit for settings

5. **Keychain for License Storage**
   - Secure encrypted storage
   - System-integrated
   - Survives app reinstall

### Performance Characteristics

**Target Metrics** (from requirements):
- Capture latency: < 500ms P95 on Apple Silicon
- Memory RSS: < 100MB steady-state
- CPU idle: < 5%

**Expected Performance**:
- Selection UI: Instant
- Screen capture: ~50-100ms
- OCR processing: ~200-400ms (depends on region size and content)
- Clipboard copy: Instant
- HUD display: < 50ms

**Total Capture Flow**: ~300-600ms (within spec)

### Security & Privacy

**Privacy-First Design**:
- All OCR happens on-device
- No screenshots uploaded
- No telemetry by default
- License check can be offline
- Temp files wiped after OCR

**Security Measures**:
- License key in Keychain (encrypted)
- HTTPS for Gumroad API
- Device binding prevents sharing
- Hardened runtime
- Code signing required
